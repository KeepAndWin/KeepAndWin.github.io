Hi there, I'm Zexi Jia. You can call me Zeron too.

This is my first try to build my own blog website.

I'm interested in AI, High-Performance Data Streaming Application and Fintech.

I just graduated from Harbin Institute of Technology, major in Computer Science and Technology. I'm pursuing my master degree at National University of Singapore.

You can find my CV here: [Jia Zexi&#39;s Curriculum Vitae](../files/Resume - Jia Zexi.pdf).
